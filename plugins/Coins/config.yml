# This plugin will drop one coin, being worth what's set at 'moneyAmount'. But here you can
# set that a mob should drop 'moneyAmount's AMOUNT of coins, with each coin being worth $1.

# The amount of money one coin is worth. Creates a random number between
# 'from' and 'to' which - as money - will be given to the player on pickup.
# However, if 'dropEachCoin' is set to true, killed mobs will drop 'from' to 'to' coins,
# with each coin being worth $1. So by default it will drop 3 to 7 coins when 'dropEachCoin' is true.

# Should coins be stacked? (Or should a coin be one on its own?)
# Stacked coins don't act like one coin. The stack is counted and the worth is multiplied.

# When a player gets killed by another player, should (three; setting above) coins drop?
playerDrop: false

# And should coins NOT drop when both players have the same ip address?
# This means that no coin(s) will be dropped if both players are from the same computer.

# Should passive mobs also drop a coin?

# Lets players use /withdraw <amount> to get a coin "<amount> <coin name>s": for example "53 Coins".
