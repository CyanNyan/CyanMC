#  Misc & Language   #
#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #

# Show a message to update the plugin on start-up, if the plugin is outdated.
check-for-updates: false

# What language should the plugin use? And what is your server's currency symbol?
#  All available languages can be found in the folder 'languages' inside the plugin
#  folder. Included languages by default: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish,
#  Swedish, Italian, Chinese, Hungarian, Russian and Turkish.
language: 'English'
currency-symbol: '$'

# This message is sent as action bar (bottom of a player's screen) by default,
#  telling the player how much money they have picked up. The variable '{currency}'
#  will be replaced by the configured value at 'currency-symbol'.
pickup-message: '&2+ &a{currency}{amount}'
pickup-message-position: 'actionbar' # other options: 'subtitle', 'title', 'chat'

# How many decimals should currency from this plugin have? Set to 0 for rounded
#  money. Setting this to 1 will do, for example: $2.3 $5.8 $8.0. Setting to 2 will
#  format like: $5.23, $3.70, $6.99. This setting will be ignored (and set to 0) if
#  'drop-each-coin' is set to true.
money-decimals: 2

# The symbols to use for separating digits (in thousands). The default values
#  (dot, and comma) format numbers, for example, like 1,000.6 or 2,100.90 (depending
#  on your setting `money-decimals`. The group separator can be empty if preferred.

#  Coin Properties   #
#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #

# Here you can configure the names of dropped coins and withdrawn coins. HEX color
#  codes are possible as well, with following format: '&#xxxxxx', where x = [0-9a-f].
# Color codes: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
dropped-coin-name: '&6Coin'
withdrawn-coin-names:
  singular: '&e{amount} &6Coin'
  plural: '&e{amount} &6Coins'

# The material that coins should be made of.
# Material list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
coin-item: 'emerald'

# You can also set a custom texture for the coin, as a skull. Filling this will
#  ignore 'coin-item'. Input the text from the example page at "Other > Value" at
#  the bottom of the page, it's a 'texture value'. For the example, that would be
#  the one starting with "eyJ0ZXh0dXJl[...]". In case you need the UUID of the
#  skull, it is always: 00000001-0001-0001-0001-000000000002.
# Example skull: https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/decoration/3005-money-bag
skull-texture: ''

# Should the coin have an enchanted effect?
enchanted-coin: true

# This value sets the custom model data value for the coin. This can be used for
#  custom textures. Default: 0 (disables the feature) You are probably only
#  interested if you use a custom texture pack.
custom-model-data: 0

#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #
#  Coin Behaviour    #
#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #

# The amount of money one coin is worth. Creates a random number between 'from' and
#  'to' which - as money - will be given to the player on pickup.
money-amount:
  from: 0.03
  to: 0.07

# Prevent hoppers from picking up dropped coins specifically. Withdrawn coins will
#  still be picked up.
disable-hoppers: false

# This plugin drops one coin by default, being worth what's set at 'money-amount'.
#  But here you can set that Coins should drop money-amount's AMOUNT of coins, with
#  each coin being worth $1. So if 'drop-each-coin' is set to true, killed mobs will
#  drop 'from' to 'to' *amount* of coins, with each coin being worth $1. So by
#  default it will drop 3 to 7 coins when 'drop-each-coin' is true.
drop-each-coin: false

# Should coins be stacked? Or should a coin be one on its own? Stacked coins don't
#  act like one coin. The stack is counted and the worth is multiplied. Not stacking
#  coins is just for a cooler effect. This setting will be ignored (and set to
#  false) if 'drop-each-coin' is set to true.
stack-coins: false

# Should a sound be played when a coin is picked up? If so, what should that sound
#  be? And at what pitch and volume should it be played at?
# Sounds: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html
pickup-sound: false

# List all worlds that you want Coins to be disabled in. World names are

#  disabledWorlds: [plots, creative]
disabled-worlds: []

# Allow players to change the name of coins. Only works if 'detect-legacy-coins' is
#  set to false. Changing the names of non-legacy coins does not make it lose its
#  value.
allow-name-change: false

# Allow players to use coins in a bench (i.e. crafting, smelting). Coin will lose
#  its value.
allow-modification: false

# Add more value to coin drops when a Looting or Fortune enchant is used. The
#  configured value is a percentage per enchantment level. Default value is 0.05 =
#  5%. Which means: Fortune/Looting I = 5% coin increase, Fortune/Looting II =
#  10% coin increase and Fortune/Looting III = 15% coin increase.
enchant-increment: 0.01

#  Coin Mob Drops    #
#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #

# Should hostile and passive mobs drop coins? Hostile mobs drop coins by default,
#  and passive mobs don't.
hostile-drop: true
passive-drop: false

# The minimum percentage of damage a player needs to deal to a mob to drop coins.
#  This can be useful for one-hit mob grinders that damage mobs from fall damage,
#  for example. Value from 0.00 to 1.00: 0.00 meaning 0%, 1.00 meaning 100%.
percentage-player-hit: 0.00

# Set the maximum amount of coin drops (from mob kills) per block location in a
#  specific time. This can be useful to prevent overuse of grinders. Defaults to 1:
#  after 1 kill at x/y/z, it won't drop coins there for the amount of hours set at
#  'location-limit-hours'. Disable by setting to 0. You may want to increase this
#  value if you're using a mob stacker plugin. (1 minute = 0.016667)
limit-for-location: 0
location-limit-hours: 1.0

# At what chance should coins drop after a mob has been killed? Default is set to a
#  chance of 90%. Accepts a value between 0.00 and 1.00.
drop-chance: 0.01

# Should mobs from spawners drop coins? Mobs from spawners won't drop a coin by
#  default. When 'false', mobs can still drop coins when the player (who killed) has
#  permission 'coins.spawner'.
spawner-drop: false

# Also drop coins when the mob is NOT killed by a player? So the mob has a natural
#  death, excluding de-spawns. That means that any death cause will have the mob
#  drop coins, not just by player kills!
drop-with-any-death: false

# You can add multipliers for specific mobs here. By default, mobs that are enabled
#  to drop coins drop one coin. Ender Dragon is added by default, so when an Ender
#  Dragon is killed, 20 coins drop. Set a mob type to 0 (i.e. 'bat': 0) to disable
#  coins for that specific type. If you want to have no mob multipliers, you can set
#  'mob-multiplier: {}'. You can also add mobs here that don't drop coins in the
#  first place, but want them to drop coins anyway. For example if 'passive-drop' is
#  false, but you still want cows and sheep to drop coins, add them down here.

# When a player gets killed by another player, should coins drop?
player-drop: false

# Should coins NOT drop when both players have the same IP address? This means that
#  no coins will be dropped if both players are from the same computer. This

#  use this plugin for a local server.

#  Coin Block Drops  #
#  #  #  #  #  #  #  #

# Drop coins for mined blocks. This setting only works when the block drops a
#  different item than the block itself. For example a Diamond Ore drops Diamond
#  without Silk Touch. So it doesn't work when using Silk Touch. That is because
#  the player would be able to place the block again, and get coins once again.
#  The number behind the block name below is the multiplier for coin drops.
# Materials: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

enable-withdraw: true
max-withdraw-amount: 10000.00

# Withdrawn coins in older versions of the plugin are handled in a fundamentally
